## Summary
The collection of data is very mismatched and does not carry the same format across all platforms.  A solution to help migrate all of the data into a unified format is to have an entity that manages all of the data on behalf of the other entities and provides a simplified format to store and retrieve the data.

## Why?
Patient data is in a lot of formats.  In a study by HIMSS in 2018, on average a hospital has 16 software suites that use and store patient data.  None of them follow a common, normalized layout for storing and displaying patient data.
